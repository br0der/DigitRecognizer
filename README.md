**Digit Classification**

This is my beginning attempt to design a neural network from the ground up. Inspiration taken from https://youtu.be/Ixl3nykKG9M?si=0LG4NtEJpKwKpvtK. No direct code taken, just the math behind it.

You can run this by cloning the respository and running main.py using python, and change it however you want. I tried to make the Network class simple to use.
